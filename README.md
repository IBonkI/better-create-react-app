# Better Create React App

Better Create React App is a small project from me which i did because i wanted to learn how to setup a React application without create-react-app.

Also i wanted to learn more about [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/) which i both used for this project

## Scripts

Starts the application in Dev Mode.
```
npm run start
```

Bundles the React Components into index_bundle.js
```
npm run build
```
